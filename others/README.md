STAP++ is a C++ finite element method (FEM) code whose input/output data files are the same as STAP90. STAP90 is a FEM code in Fortran 90 provided by our textbook (Xiong Zhang, Tianshu Wang. Computational Dynamics, Tsinghau University Press, 2007; Xiong Zhang, Tianshu Wang, Yan Liu. Computational Dynamics (2nd edition), Tsinghau University Press, 2015)

STAP++ is developed for the course "Finite Element Method" delivered by Professor Xiong Zhang (xzhang@tsinghua.edu.cn) in the School of Aerospace Engineering at Tsinghua University. It helps students to understand the basic implementation techniques of the FEM, and servers as a starting point for students to practice programming the FEM.

STAP++ is a cross-platform FEM code, which can be build on Windows, Linux and macOS. The native makefiles and workspaces can be generated by using CMake (https://cmake.org) from the file src/CMakeLists.txt.

STAP++ is developed and maintained by the Computational Dynamics Laboratory (http://www.comdyn.cn/), School of Aerospace Engineering, Tsinghua University, China. Your feedbacks are welcome.

The documentation of STAP++ can be found at https://xzhang66.github.io/stappp/index.html.
